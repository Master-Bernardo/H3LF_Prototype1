Animations:

- all animations which should be scaled in tame should consist of 30 frames in lender


naming convention for the animation in blender is: 


for movement:

Stance_Idle/CIdle_MovementName

CIdle stands for CombatIdle

so for running in combat:  1HSword1_CombatIdle_Running
for standing outside of combat: Spear&Shield1_Idle_Standing

not every stance needs an idle stand, some may share the default one


for combat movement:

Stance_MovementName_MovementType

1HSword1_Stab1_PrepareAttack
